      <WelcomeLine>ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! Iâ€™m Bob Matyas, an experienced web developer living in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I like moving pixels around using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </WelcomeLine> 

      <p>I work as a Happiness Engineer at Automattic where I help folks using self-hosted WordPress succeed using Jetpack.</p>

      <p>Outside of my job duties, Iâ€™m passionate about accessibility, user experience, web performance, and the open web. I have been building websites since the late 1990s. I remember the days â€“ and pain â€“ of folks making sites using strange hacks and table-based layouts. Weâ€™ve come a long way since then and I love learning the new things coming to the web platform. </p>

      <p>When Iâ€™m not working online, Iâ€™m most likely to be found in probably in the woods, riding a bike, foraging for wild plants, or cooking (hopefully) tasty vegan food.</p>
