      <WelcomeLine>ðŸ‘‹ Howdy! Iâ€™m Bob Matyas, a web developer living in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I like moving pixels around using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </WelcomeLine> 

      <p>I work at Automattic where I help make the web a better place.</p>

      <p>Iâ€™m passionate about accessibility, user experience, web performance, and the open web. I have been building websites since the late 1990s. I remember the days â€“ and pain â€“ of folks making sites using strange hacks and table-based layouts. Weâ€™ve come a long way since then and I love learning the new things coming to the web platform. </p>

      <p>When Iâ€™m not working online, Iâ€™m most likely to be found in the woods, riding a bike, foraging for wild plants, or cooking (hopefully) tasty vegan food.</p>

      <h2>Portfolio</h2>

      <p>I have <Link to={`/portfolio/`}>a portfolio</Link> of non-work projects available here.</p>
      <h2>Get in Touch</h2>

      <p>If you want to get in touch, you can use <Link to={`/contact/`}>this form</Link>.</p>
