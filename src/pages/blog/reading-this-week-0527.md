Here's some web development articles that I have been reading over the past week.

## Development 

- **[What Does it Mean to Be “Full Stack”?](https://css-tricks.com/what-does-it-mean-to-be-full-stack/)** - A nice article by Chris Coyier about what it means to be a full stack developer in 2019. 
- **[Vue.js And SEO: How To Optimize Reactive Websites For Search Engines And Bots](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/05/vue-js-seo-reactive-websites-search-engines-bots/)** - After spending considerable time on SEO related optimization for various projects over the years, I have often wondered about the SEO implications of JavaScript frameworks. This article does a pretty good job of exploring the issue and concluding it isn't as big of a deal as it once was. 
- **[An introduction to the JAMstack: the architecture of the modern web](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-the-jamstack-the-architecture-of-the-modern-web-c4a0d128d9ca/)** - A nice, quick intro to the JAMstack (JAM - JavaScript, APIs, Markup) that we hear so much about these days. For more detailed reading, [JAMstack.wtf](https://jamstack.wtf/) is a good source.
- **[The Vanilla JS Toolkit](https://vanillajstoolkit.com/)** - This is a really helpful site emphasize all that you can do in JavaScript without needing a front-end framework. Lots of examples, helper functions, etc -- definitely worth checking out. I think of it in the same realm as [You Might Not Need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/). 
- **[Best Free Form Builder Plugins WordPress 2019](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/best-free-form-plugin-wordpress/)** - I thought maybe I was the only one who found the state of WordPress form plugins to be exceedingly frustrating, but apparently not. Some good suggestions in here for plugins for a task that really shouldn't be as frustrating as it is...


## Design Exercises 

I have found that I'm much more inclined to work on my front-end skills if I have some plausible scenarios to work on and/or a specific project, otherwise I get stuck trying to come up with ideas rather than coding. The following are some nice resources for practicing your skills:

- **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)** - Definitely my favorite, this site offers a number of challenges and has an active community around it. 
- **[Brief Box](https://briefbox.me/briefs/)** - More design than development oriented, but it offers a bunch of prompts for design exercises, some of which are websites. 
- **[Symu](https://symu.co/freebies/)** - This site gives users PSD files of designs for various websites. You can then code the sites from the mocks.

## Random Design Stuff

- **[Should I Use A Carousel?](http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/)** - A snarky take on an all-too-common design pattern.
- **[Can't Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/)** - A nice quiz-formatted resource for learning basic UI/UX concepts.
