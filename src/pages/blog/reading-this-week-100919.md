When I initially thought about starting a blog, part of my motivation was to have a place to keep useful resources that I come across. I had been relying on Twitter to do that, but its ephermal nature makes it hard to go back and find what I need. Now that I have updated my site to use Gatsby, it's easier to update so I'm looking forward to doing these posts more often.

## Books

- **[Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)** - I have been reading Brad Frost's classic book over the past week. It contains a wealth of insight on how to break an interface/website down into small building blocks. With so much of front-end web development moving in the component direction, this has been a helpful resource for me to think more in terms of reusable components.
