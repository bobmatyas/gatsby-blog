description: "A collection of articles on web development and UI/UX."

For the past several months I have been using my Twitter to keep track of web development articles that I’ve read and learned something from, want to save for future reference, or otherwise wanted to keep handy. I now am realizing that Twitter wasn’t the best choice for that. While my best bet would probably be something akin to the old website [del.icio.us]( (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delicious_(website)) (anyone remember that?) I’m going to start to save articles on this blog.

## Development 

- **[How Frontend Developers Can Help To Bridge The Gap Between Designers and Developers](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/05/frontend-developers-designers/)** - A nice look at the role developers can play in making for better relationships with designers.
- **[HTTP Headers for the Responsible Developer](https://www.twilio.com/blog/a-http-headers-for-the-responsible-developer)** – This is a great discussion and reference piece on HTTP headers and the role they play in web security.
- **[Angular 1 Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md)** – This is a good guide on some best practices for AngularJS.
- **[Replacing jQuery with Vue.js: No Build Step Necessary](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/02/jquery-vue-javascript/)** - This is older article but its proposal of moving from jQuery to Vue.js for some simple functionality (toggling classes, hiding and showing, submitting a form) is appealing. It seems like a good way to get your feet wet with Vue.js. 
      
## UX/UI 

- **[Privacy UX: Privacy-Aware Design Framework](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/privacy-ux-aware-design-framework/)** - This four part series from Smashing Magazine was an excellent look the intersection of privacy and design. In addition to the last article (linked above), I’d recommend the other three: [Privacy Concerns and Privacy in Web Forms](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/privacy-concerns-ux-web-forms/), [Better Cookie Consent Experiences](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/privacy-ux-better-cookie-consent-experiences/), and [Better Notifications UX and Permissions Requests](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/04/privacy-better-notifications-ux-permission-requests/).
- **[Trans-Inclusive Design](https://alistapart.com/article/trans-inclusive-design/)** - This is a must read article that covers (in part) the ways in which designers and developers can make decisions that exclude trans folks.
