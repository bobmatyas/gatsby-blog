Here's some articles over the past week or so that have caught my eye:

## Web Development

- **[Illustrated Guide to CSS Grid](http://grid.malven.co/)** - This is a really useful guide to CSS Grid with illustrations. It seems very helpful for making the transition to grid-based CSS layouts.
- **[Modern JavaScript features you may have missed](http://www.breck-mckye.com/blog/2019/10/modern-javascript-features-you-may-have-missed/)** - A nice quick overview of some modern JavaScript features that you may not have used yet.

- **[HTMHell](https://www.htmhell.dev/)** - "A collection of bad practices in HTML, copied from real websites."

In general, I think it's best to do as much as you can with CSS before implementing JavaScript-based solutions.
- **[How to Write Accessible Javascript](https://benrobertson.io/accessibility/javascript-accessibility)** - This is a bit older but was recommended at a local Meetup here in Grand Rapids as a starting point for JavaScript developers interested in writing more accessible code. It covers the importance of using buttons, keyboard interactions, ARIA states, and focus. 
- **[Auditing For Accessibility Problems With Firefox Developer Tools](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/10/auditing-for-accessibility-problems-with-firefox-developer-tools/)** - A nice guide to using the Firefox developer tools to find accessibility problems.
