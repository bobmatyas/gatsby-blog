One of my favorite ways to practice CSS and keep my skills sharp is to use the excellent layout challenges from Frontend Mentor. This is my solution to [the FAQ Accordion Card](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam) challenge.

My solution is embedded in this pen from CodePen:

## Notes

There isn't anything too signifcant to report on this challenge. As always I approrched it mobile first and made use of Normalize.css, CSS Custom Properties, and modern layout techniques (Flexbox in this case). One thing that was an a bit of an unexpected challenge was the illustration, which uses two background images and an absolutely positioned element on desktop. It is also worth noting that I made use of [the Details element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) for a solution that doesn't require JavaScript.
