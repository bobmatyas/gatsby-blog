This is was a quick layout project based on the Testimonials Grid challenge from Frontend Mentor.

My solution is embedded in this pen from CodePen:

## Notes

The layout of this design made it a perfect candidate for CSS Grid. As always, I started by making the mobile design first and then applying the grid display once it scales up to desktop. It was pretty easy to accomplish using modern CSS techniques.
