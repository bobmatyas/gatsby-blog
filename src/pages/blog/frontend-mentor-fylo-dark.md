One of my favorite ways to practice CSS and keep my skills sharp is to use the excellent layout challenges from Frontend Mentor. This is my solution to [the FAQ Accordion Card](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam) challenge.

## Notes

This was a fun little layout challenge from Frontend Mentor. I built it mobile first and made use of modern CSS techniques including Flexbox and CSS Grid where appropriate.
