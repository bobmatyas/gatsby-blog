---

Over the past week or so I haven't had as much time to read articles, I have been using my spare time to work on getting some more practice on Node, Express, and MongoDB.  

## Web Development

- **[Front-end Fisticuffs: Angular vs React vs Vue in 2019](https://leewarrick.com/blog/angular-vs-react-vs-vue/) - This is a a good comparison of the "good, bad, and ugly" of the top 3 JavaScript frameworks by someone who has used them all. I think it offered a lot of insight in a pretty approachable way.
- **[The 2019 React JS Developer RoadMap](https://medium.com/javarevisited/the-2019-react-js-developer-roadmap-9a8e290b8a56) - This is a nice roadmap offering a recommended learning path for React JS along with links to courses and resources covering each of the topics.
- **[JAMstack Tools and The Spectrum of Classification](https://css-tricks.com/jamstack-tools-and-the-spectrum-of-classification/) - A nice post listing many different JAMStack options: CMSs, hosting, and static site generators.
- **[Why Parcel Has Become My Go-To Bundler for Development](https://css-tricks.com/why-parcel-has-become-my-go-to-bundler-for-development/) - Parcel seems like a great bundler and has perhaps the best feature ever -- NO CONFIGURATION!
- **[Thinking in React Hooks](https://wattenberger.com/blog/react-hooks) - From the article: "React introduced hooks one year ago, and they've been a game-changer for a lot of developers. There are tons of how-to introduction resources out there, but I want to talk about the fundamental mindset change when switching from React class components to function components + hooks."


## Books

- **[React Handbook](https://flaviocopes.com/page/react-handbook/)** - I came across this free ebook via freeCodeCamp. I am a few chapters / sections in and I am treating it primarily as review. It's been an alright read so far and I'm really hoping that when I get to hooks it will offer some important insights.

## Other Resources

- **[is-website-vulnerable](https://github.com/lirantal/is-website-vulnerable) - An NPM script that you can run to find publicly known security vulnerabilities in a website's JavaScript libraries. Its existent is even more of a reason to keep things updated.
- **[Build a Classic Layout FAST in CSS Grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOvGeFUHAC0) - A nice video from Mozilla providing an introduction to CSS Grid.
