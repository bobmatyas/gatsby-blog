Now that I have successfully completed my coding bootcamp, I am making plans to continue my learning. Over the past year of prepping for my bootcamp and the course itself, I've learned that I really like having structured learning plans and times set aside specifically for learning.

To that end, here's the things I'm focusing on for React:


## Podcasts

I like podcasts and they seem helpful for giving a broad overview of React before diving in. Here's a few that have been useful:

- **[Syntax.fm - The React Episode](https://syntax.fm/show/066/the-react-episode)** 
- **[Getting Started with React](https://devchat.tv/react-round-up/rru-001-getting-started-react/)** 

## Books 

I still like books. Unfortunately, programming books can go out of date a bit too quickly, but here's a couple I am planning to read through:

- **[Learning React: Functional Web Development with React and Redux](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-React-Functional-Development-Redux/dp/1491954620)** - This has a nice introduction to functional programming that seems like it will be useful.
- **[Fullstack React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/)** - An updated ebook on learning React.
- **[30 Days of React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/30-days-of-react/)** - An ebook full of short snippets to help familiarize yourself with React.

## Courses

- **[Lynda.com "Learning React.js"](https://www.lynda.com/React-js-tutorials/Learning-React-js/800214-2.html)** - My local library offers Lynda.com courses for free, so I'm give this one a try as an intro. There's also a longer course called ["React for Web Designers"](https://www.lynda.com/React-js-tutorials/React-Web-Designers/5043103-2.html) that looks good.
- **[freeCodeCamp: Frontend Libraries Certification](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/)** - freeCodeCamp's Frontend Libraries course prominently features React. I plan to go through this course and complete the final projects using React.

## Meetups and In-Person Learning 

There are also a couple of in-person Meetups on React where I live, so I'm going to check those out.
